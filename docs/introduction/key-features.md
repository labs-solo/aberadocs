## Overview

## 1. Enhanced Capital Efficiency

## 2. Simplified $BGT Participation

**Challenge Addressed**: $BGT participation on Kodiak requires an Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM).

- **Concentrated Liquidity Management**: AquaBera enables any pool to be compatible with the $BGT emission system without requiring that any capital be deployed that is ineligible for $BGT emissions. AquaBera manages concentrated liquidity positions represented by NFTs, making them eligible for gauges and distributing LP tokens to users.

  - **Interactive Element**: FAQs addressing common questions about NFT-based liquidity positions.

- **No Third-Party Swaps**: AquaBera never swaps against third-party liquidity to manage its asset mix. Instead, it adjusts ranges to produce off-balance liquidity near the price as needed to address shortages of one token or the other.
