# Focus on Asset Conservation

AquaBera utilizes an "inventory-aware" strategy, focusing on asset conservation. It offers distinctive LP tokens for single-token contributions to liquidity pools, aligning with depositorsâ€™ asset growth ambitions without necessitating active oversight. This model guarantees that trades support the goal of asset value preservation and mitigates the risk of asset owners being forced to sell their tokens under unfavorable conditions.
