# Enhancing Participation for Neutral Market Makers

Neutral participants can allocate half of their capital in one token and the other half in the other token. Unlike 'follow-the-price' ALMs, which require frequent adjustments to maintain this exposure, AquaBeraâ€™s design ensures that these positions are maintained via adjustments to price ranges without additional effort. This system simplifies the process for passive asset owners and optimizes it for true market makers seeking balanced exposure without paying trading fees.
